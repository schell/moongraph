# üåô moongraph üìà

`moongraph` is a Rust library for scheduling, managing resources, and running directed acyclic graphs.

In a `moongraph`, nodes are functions with parameters that are accessed immutably, mutably or by move.

`moongraph` validates and schedules nodes to run in parallel where possible, using `rayon` as the underlying parallelizing tech (WIP).

## what

`moongraph` is made up of two parts:

* The scheduler - provided by [`dagga`](https://github.com/schell/dagga)
* The resource manager - provided by [`broomdog`](https://github.com/schell/broomdog)

## why

Scheduling and running DAGs is a common problem and I didn't find any prior art.

## uses

`moongraph` is in use in a number of other libraries (let me know if you use it in yours, and how :))

* As the render graph in [`renderling`](https://github.com/schell/renderling), a scrappy real-time renderer with advanced lighting
* Its scheduler is used for scheduling systems in [`apecs`](https://github.com/schell/apecs), a well-performing ECS with async integration.
